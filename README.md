Ohkay was a fun photo-editing app I built in a couple days the summer after my senior year in high school. I wrote it in Swift for the iOS platform and it has several neat features. First, I got experience developing an intuitive user interface. As far as features are concerned, it allows you to overlay multiple filters onto the your selected image, paint and add text to the image with different sizes and colors, and add a few graphics to these images. You can also change the size and orientation of the graphics. It was accepted by the iOS app store, but my Apple developer membership died recently, so I put it in GitHub because I want to keep my first project alive in some form.
